# GenModInvasion
#### How long until genetically modified humans rule the planet?

This is a toy project with the goal of modeling adoption of human genetic modification and its spread through the
 population.

#### Modification strategy
- Somatic (gene therapy)
  - Genomic integration
  - Episomal retention
- Germline
- Cloning

#### Types
- Introduction of functional alleles to cure rare disease (particularly metabolic disorders)
  - easiest to implement, but will not sweep a population because most people do not have these disorders
- Introduction of beneficial alleles to reduce impact of common disease (e.g., heart disease, diabetes)
  - Must account for the balance between reducing disease risk and adverse (cancer) risks following GT
- Designer modifications (e.g., eye color, ACTN3 557R)
  - Ethics and popular acceptance are key factors here

#### Data-vis
- Maybe use [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com/maps/demo/all-maps) to visualize data directly on maps?
- Use [value sliders](http://rangeslider.js.org/) to adjust variable parameters
